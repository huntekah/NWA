Buffer overflow in ntpd ntp daemon 4.0.99k and earlier (aka xntpd and xntp3) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary commands via a long readvar argument.

opis:
ping sends an ICMP Echo Request packet to an IP address. If a host is up at that address it will reply with an ICMP Echo Reply. The reply includes the data portion of the echo packet. The data included in the Echo Request varies across different operating system implementations.

opis: 
Multiple TCP/IP and ICMP implementations allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reset TCP connections) via spoofed ICMP error messages, aka the "blind connection-reset attack." NOTE: CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying vulnerability. While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations and solutions that address the attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities.

The portmapper service registers all RPC services on UNIX hosts. It can be queried for all RPC services running, the RPC program name and version, the protocol (TCP or UDP), and the port where the service listens. This can provide an attacker valuable information about which RPC services offered and on which ports.

An attacker can query a DNS server for the version of BIND running. Some versions of BIND, by default, respond to these queries while BIND version 9; by default, does not. A response to this query can assist an attacker in discovering servers that are potentially vulnerable to exploits associated with specific versions of BIND.
